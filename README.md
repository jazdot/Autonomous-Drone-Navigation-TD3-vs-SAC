# Autonomous-Drone-Navigation-PPO-vs-SAC
Comparative Study of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) for Autonomous Drone Navigation using ROS and Gazebo. This project explores the performance of these algorithms in complex environments, focusing on navigation efficiency, obstacle avoidance, and learning efficiency.
