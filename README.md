# Comparative Study of Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) for Autonomous Drone Navigation

## Objective
This project aims to develop and compare the performance of Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithms for autonomous drone navigation. The evaluation will focus on navigation efficiency, obstacle avoidance, and learning efficiency in simulated environments using ROS2 and Gazebo.
